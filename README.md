## Irix Libtorrent Client

Depends on an already installed libtorrent + boost + libdicl.

It's basically some little modifications to the libtorrent "client_test" program to avoid issues with terminal escape codes that IRIX winterm + others can't handle (mainly colours + extended chars).

Work in progress.
